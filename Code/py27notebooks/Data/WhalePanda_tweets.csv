914825091669807104,2017-10-02 12:11:13,The main reason being: bagholders/believers. With a regular VC funded startup you have (potentially) a handful of investors. That's it.
914825011533434881,2017-10-02 12:10:54,Most startups fail. Most ICOs will fail. But I would argue that the percentage of failed ICO startups will be lower than regular (VC) ones.
